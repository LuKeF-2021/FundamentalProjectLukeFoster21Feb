### Project requirements  
The MVP for this project was as follows:  
* A database with one or more tables.
* CRUD functionality on atleast one table.
* testing of code implemented.
* Database hosted on GCP SQL server.
* Risk assessment relevant to the project.
* ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram).
* Front-End webpage on localhost for users to enter data into db.  
<br>
<br>
<h3> Why I chose a champion database </h3>
The MVP was to incorporate CRUD functionality into the application, my idea satisfied this criteria but also had scope  
to expand the application with other functionality as strech goals and to display my coding proficiency/understanding.  
<br>
The application at the very least, upon completion, would be able to add champion details from the popular MOBA game  
League of Legends, read the contents of the champions listed in the table, update a specific champion if any details  
changed about them, and also delete the record of a champion requested by the user.  
<br>
<h3>General approach to project</h3>
To make the front end of the application HTML, CSS and JavaScript were needed. The back end or 'Business Layer' of the application  
leveraged Java with SpringBoot, and finally the database was hosted on GCP (Google Cloud Platform). While extra functionality can  
be interesting and appealing to the user, to ensure a successful project was submitted the specifications in the MVP needed to be  
focused on first and foremost. To seperate the essential from the 'would be nice to have', a MOSCOW analysis was incorporated as  
stated below:  
<br>
<br>
Must have:  
* One DB table with CRUD functionality: Add, Read, Update, Delete Champions. Hosted on GCP.
* Jira board with epics, user stories and tasks.
* Evidence of testing to some degree within the application back-end.
* Functioning front-end webpage(s) that interact with the back-end and DB.
* Documentation e.g. Risk Assessment.  
Should have:  
* Home Page with form for input.  
Could have:  
* Seperate pages for Create, Read, Update and Delete Forms.
* Visual representation of table contents on webpage (e.g. html table)
* Custom queries that the user can filter champions by, such as cost, release year.
* Some Level of Styling and formatting done to the webpage so it's not as bland.
* Second table that keeps track of champions on sale, and relates back to the main table.  
Wont have:  
* Professional level webpage design.  
<br>
<br>
Further into this document it will be clear that some of the functionality outside of the 'must have' section was implemented.  
However, by setting expectations early about what to focus on, the MVP was completed first and extra features added afterwards.
