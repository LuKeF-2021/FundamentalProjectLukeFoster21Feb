### Project requirements  
The MVP for this project was as follows:  
* A database with one or more tables.
* CRUD functionality on atleast one table.
* testing of code implemented.
* Database hosted on GCP SQL server.
* Risk assessment relevant to the project.
* ERD (Entity Relationship Diagram).
* Front-End webpage on localhost for users to enter data into db.

changed about them, and also delete the record of a champion requested by the user.

focused on first and foremost. To seperate the essential from the 'would be nice to have', a MOSCOW analysis was incorporated as
